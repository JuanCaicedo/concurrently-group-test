# Concurrently group output test

This repo is made to test out
the [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently) npm package.
I am trying to add a feature to group all output by command that emitted it.

#### How to test

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run one-two-three
$ npm run three-one-two
```
